# Reactive-UI

**Reactive-UI** is a set of ReactJS Components, that works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

And when we don't need to define different versions for both screens - we can create one universal design.**

Thanks to ReactJS - it's possible to create complex logic behind simple interface of any Component.
Developer need to describe design once, and based on screen size UI will be rendered differently.
And even if we need to transform sidebar into tabs or dropdown - we can control this separately for mobile and desktop.
Otherwise it will work as designed by default.

## Our priorities

1. **Ensure bug-free components.** It means that we carefully test each component before release. But if you found that Button looks strange in a List, then open a bug and we will fix it as soon as possible.
2. **Design each component to provide the best UX.** Component should feels like native or at least very intuitive on each device - mobile, tablet and desktop.
