And when we don't need to define different versions for both screens - we can create one universal design.**

Thanks to ReactJS - it's possible to create complex logic behind simple interface of any Component.
Developer need to describe design once, and based on screen size UI will be rendered differently.
And even if we need to transform sidebar into tabs or dropdown - we can control this separately for mobile and desktop.
Otherwise it will work as designed by default.
