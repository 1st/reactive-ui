# Reactive-UI

**Reactive-UI** is a set of ReactJS UI components, that works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

Insperide by Material Design and Twitter Bootstrap frameworks.
I found that they tried to implement all-in-one framework to build mobile and desktop design in one universal code.

My visiton that we need to have different designs for mobile and dektop instead of universal one.
It allows to make UI better optimized for mobile and desktop, because we create two different wersions of design.

Thanks to ReactJS it's possible to create complex logic behind simple interface of any component.
